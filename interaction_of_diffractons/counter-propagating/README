Code to generate the results in the section Counter-propagating 
     collision and animations about it. 
** Run psystem.py to generate all the data. This is an expensive 
   simulation; therefore, we include the data to generate the plots 
   in the mentioned section. 
** Run plots_to_paper.py to generate the plots in the paper. 
** Run plots_to_animation.py to generate the plots for an animation. 
** Run the script make_gifs and/or make_movs to generate animations.
   To make the animations one has to run psystem.py first. 	     
   The animations are placed within a folder called animations.
   To generate these animations one has to install ImageMagick making 
   sure the delegates GhostScript (to deal with eps files) and ffmpeg 
   (to generate mov files) are previously installed. With homebrew all 
   these can be installed by typing:
    	brew install ghostscript
	brew install --force ffmpeg
	brew install --force imagemagick
