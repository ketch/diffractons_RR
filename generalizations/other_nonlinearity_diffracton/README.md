# GENERALIZATIONS: DIFFERENT NONLINEARITY 

Code to generate the diffracton with different nonlinearity in 
     section Generalizations.
You can reproduce the plot in the paper as follows:

    make
    python psystem.py
    python plots_to_paper.py

This simulation is computationally expensive; therefore, we include the data
required to generate the plots in the paper.
