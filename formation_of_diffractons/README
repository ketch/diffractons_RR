Code to generate the results in section Formation of diffractons and 
     animations about it. 
** Run psystem.py to generate the FV simulations. 
   These simulations are computationally expensive; therefore, we 
   include the data files to create the plots in the paper. 
** To generate the plots in the paper just run plot_to_paper.py
** To generate "nice looking" surface plots run the python file 
   write_sol_to_txt.py and then the matlab file 
   surface_plots/plot_surface.m
** To generate animations (gif and mov) run first psystem.py and 
   then the script make_gifs and/or make_movs. 
   To generate these animations one has to install 
   ImageMagick making sure the delegates GhostScript (to deal with 
   eps files) and ffmpeg (to generate mov files) are previously 
   installed. With homebrew all these can be installed by typing: 
    	brew install ghostscript
	brew install --force ffmpeg
	brew install --force imagemagick
