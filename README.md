Reproducibility repository for paper on diffractons
====================================================
Code to accompany the paper 
[*Diffractons: solitary waves created by diffraction in periodic media*](https://doi.org/10.1137/130946526), by D. I. Ketcheson and M. Quezada de Luna.  Published in SIAM MM&S; the free preprint is also available on the [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4122).

Subdirectories:

 - **pyclaw**: Code and data for Figures 3, 5, (9,10,11), 13, and 14,
   which show results of PyClaw simulations.
 - **spectral**: Code and data for Figures 4 and 12, which show results of
   pseudospectral simulations.
 - **scaling**: Code and data for Figures 7-8.  Only post-processing scripts are
   provided; if you wish to re-generate the data, use the code for Figure 5
   (from the *pyclaw* directory).
 - **speed**: Code and data for Figure 6.  Again if you wish to re-generate the
   data, use the code for Figure 5.

Note that the data for Figure 14 has been compressed.  You must uncompress it first
if you wish to plot it.
