** There are 4 folders: het_matchC_linear, het_matchC_nonlinear, 
   het_miss-matchC_linear and het_miss-matchC_nonlinear, 
   for the different situations considered in this section. Within 
   each folder there are two python files: stegoton.py and plot.py.
** Run first stegoton.py and then plot.py for all four folders. This 
   will generate the data and different plots for the stress and 
   strain.
   These simulations are computationally expensive; therefore, we add
   the data required to generates the plots in the paper.
** Run plots_to_paper.py to generate the plots in the mentioned 
   section.
** Run the script make_gifs and/or make_movs to generate animations. 
   To make the animations one has to run stegoton.py first. 
   The animations are placed within a folder called animations.
   To generate these animations one has to install ImageMagick making 
   sure the delegates GhostScript (to deal with eps files) and ffmpeg 
   (to generate mov files) are previously installed. With homebrew all 
   these can be installed by typing: 
    	brew install ghostscript
	brew install --force ffmpeg
	brew install --force imagemagick
